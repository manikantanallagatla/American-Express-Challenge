#***American Express Challenge:***

----------
###*Aim*:

----------


To model the training set provided and make predictions for the leador board dataset.

-------------
###*Softwares Used*:

-------------
Octave.

-------------
###*Language Written*:

-------------
octave language

-------------
###*Algorithm*:

-------------
Neural networks is used to model the training set. The value of lamda(regularisation parameter) is set to an optimum value by slowing increasing its value and plotting accurasy on the trainig set. Then in the same way, the value of number of layers in the middle hiidem layer is set optimally. For furter details on the implementation see the process.ppt file.

-------------
###*Usage*:

-------------
Training folder contains NeuralNetworksTest.m which is used for trainig and Prediction folder contains simpleTest.m which gives the prediction values.
