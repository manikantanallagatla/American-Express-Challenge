  <h2 id="Background">Background </h2>
  <p>The Island of Hoenn is gearing up for  upcoming polls. Citizens are waiting with bated breath as news agencies reveal  their predictions on which party is likely to emerge victorious.</p>
    <p>Much to the disappointment of all the  citizens, there is discrepancy in these poll predictions amongst news channels.</p>
    <p>So many inconsistent predictions didn’t go  down well with an inquisitive bunch of students. Wondering how difficult it  might be to crack it, comes their 'Eureka' moment.</p>
    <p>An idea to create their own ‘Start Up’ to  analyze poll sentiments and predict the winner. A start up called - <strong>Analyze This.</strong></p>
    <p>They gather data for a sample of citizens of  Island of Hoenn and get started.</p>
     <p>Information on <strong>historical voting pattern</strong>, <strong>rally  attendance</strong>, <strong>party agenda</strong> and <strong>demographics</strong> is what they have at hand  to predict the winner amongst the 5 competing parties.</p>
    <p>Can you help these students crack this  puzzle? Do you have it in you to start your own Analyze This?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <h2 id="ProblemStatement">Problem Statement</h2>
    Based on the data the students above have  collected, you have to:
  <ol>
    <li>Identify which citizen is likely to  remain loyal and vote for the same party as they voted for in the last polls.</li>
    <li>Identify which citizen is likely to  switch votes and NOT vote for the same party as they voted for in the last  polls.</li>
    <li>Identify  overall winner of the polls. </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="DataforAnalysis">Data  for Analysis</h2>
  <p>The following files can be downloaded for your analysis</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Training_Dataset.csv</strong>:  This data is for historical votes and voting preference of a sample of citizens.  The data has information on: 
   <ol type="a">
    <li>Past history of voting for all  citizens </li>
    <li>Who they will vote for in upcoming  polls</li>
    <li>Donation, Rally Attendance,  Demographics of these citizens </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Leaderboard_Dataset.csv</strong>:  It has information on the historical vote for all citizens along with donation,  rally attendance and demographics. </li>
    <li><strong>Final_Dataset.csv</strong>:  It has information on the historical vote for all citizens along with donation,  rally attendance and demographics.</li>
    <li><strong>Data_Dictionary.xlsx</strong>:  This sheet will give you the descriptions of all the variables contained in the  3 datasets above. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Please note that the <strong>Leader board  data</strong> submissions are restricted to only <strong>10 submissions per day  per team</strong> and for the <strong>Final dataset</strong> you can submit <strong>only  one solution. </strong>For further details, please refer to the submission  guidelines document available at the link below: <br>
<a href="https://in.axpcampus.com/AnalyzeThis/campusactivity/guidelines-and-submission.php">https://in.axpcampus.com/AnalyzeThis/campusactivity/guidelines-and-submission.php</a> </p>
  <h2 id="CluesandMilestones">Clues  and Milestones </h2>
  <p>During the game <strong>1 clue will be</strong> released in order to help you solve the problem better. </p>
   <p>This clue has the potential to give an extra boost to your solutions provided  you can use them to your advantage. Check your mails regularly for information  about the clues and keep an eye on the web site too.</p>
   <p>We have defined <strong>1 Milestone</strong> on the scores calculated for the Leader Board Submissions. <br>
   </p><p>The first 2 teams to cross a milestone will be awarded. The milestone will  appear on the leader board on the site. </p>
   <p>Milestone Score: <strong>600,000</strong></p>
  <h2 id="TipsonDataAnalysis">Tips  on Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>Following are some tips for the uninitiated  on how you can approach this data analysis game.</p>
    <p>Any exercise in the field of data analytics would start with understanding the  data. &nbsp;So, start off by understanding the datasets and descriptions  provided to you.</p>
    <p>Once you are familiar with the data, try to answer these questions:<br>
    <br>
    1.&nbsp;What all data do I have?<br>
    2.&nbsp;What all data is useful and what is junk?<br>
    3.&nbsp;How can I organize this data to solve my problem?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Then, try to build the variables on the training dataset, define dependent and  independent variables and then start modeling on the Training Dataset. You need  to match the citizen’s choice of vote.<br>
    <br>
    Once you are satisfied with your model, use it on the Leaderboard and come up  with your estimates of which poll results for each citizen. Follow the  submission guidelines and upload your estimates. Your submission will be  evaluated real time and you can compare how well you have estimated against  other participants.<br>
    <br>
    Keep fine tuning your estimates by trying to increase your leader board scores.  Keep an eye on the clues to better your solution. Once satisfied, use the same  logic to estimate the vote preference of citizens in the final dataset.<br>
    <br>
    You can use any tool, write your own algorithms, and implement any predictive  modeling/Data analysis methods you may want to. For your final submission, you  will have to provide details of the techniques you have used.</p>
  <h2 id="PopularDataAnalysisTechniques">Popular  Data Analysis Techniques</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Regression:</strong> <br>
      Regression is a mathematical process used to find a function that closely fits  a series of data. The analysis involves defining the function that minimizes  the difference between the data point and the value predicted by the function.  There are several different techniques, the most common being by the method of  least squares.&nbsp;</li>
 
  <p>For example, say  you wanted to find an equation that dictated a certain stock's performance. You  could take the closing price of that stock for every day in the last year. You  then would be trying to figure out what equation satisfies all those points.  The equation could be used to try to predict future performance.</p>

    <li><strong>Logistic  Regression: </strong><br>
      Say, you want to figure out whether the stock price for a certain day would go  up or not. You would again have the closing price of that stock for every day  in the last year. We can do this using Logistic Regression. It gives you the  probability of stock price rising.</li>
    <li><strong>Support  Vector Machine: </strong><br>
      Imagine the previous scenario. In addition to closing price we have say some  more indicators like volume traded as well, and we have a reason to believe  that the price (as is often the case) is a complex function of these  indicators. Then, to predict the upward or downward trends, SVM could be a  better technique for the solution. </li>
    <li><strong>Neural  Networks:</strong><br>
      Again, referring to the previous example, let's say, that we have certain  indicators which are themselves complex functions of several different  variables, and suppose we want to use them for the final prediction. In such a  scenario, neural networks may give a better solution. <br>
      <br>
      A point to note, as we go down this hierarchy we might end up over fitting the  data.</li>
    <li><strong>Clustering  algorithms :</strong><br>
      Clustering algorithms are used in search engines that try to group similar  objects in one cluster and the dissimilar objects far from each other. It  provides result for the searched data according to the nearest similar object  which are clustered around the data to be searched.&nbsp;<br>
      As an illustration, Google uses clustering algorithms to classify different  contents as News by parsing though the matter and examining the keywords. </li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation  engines: </strong><br>
      Amazon/Flipkart/Netflix use collaborative filtering for recommendation. <br>
      In essence, the algorithm represents each customer as a vector of all items on  sale. Each entry in the vector is positive if the customer bought or rated the  item, negative if the customer disliked the item, or empty if the customer has  not made his or her opinion known. Most of the entries are empty for most of  the customers. The algorithm then creates its recommendations by calculating a  similarity value between the current customer and everyone else.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Naïve  Bayesian Text Classifier</strong>: <br>
      The best known use of Naïve Bayesian classification is spam filtering. It is a  probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.<br>
      For example, Emails use Bayes' formula for calculating the probability of an  email to be classified as a spam, given already existing spams. This can be  done by calculating probabilities associated with each word of the text to be  classified as a spam. </li>
